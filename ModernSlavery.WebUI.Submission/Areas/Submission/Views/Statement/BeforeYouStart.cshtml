            To use this service, you will need to provide us with some basic information about your most recent modern slavery statement.

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            We will then ask you some additional questions about your statement. These are optional – but we strongly encourage you to complete them. All our questions relate to the period covered by your statement.

            When you submit your answers, we will publish all the information you’ve provided as a summary of your statement on the Modern slavery statement registry on GOV.UK. This will include a link to the full statement on your website. It will be available for public viewing.

            After we’ve published your answers, you can still make changes and resubmit. Your updated information will then replace your original answers on the registry. There is no time limit on changing and resubmitting your answers.
