            To use this service, you will need to provide us with some basic information about your most recent modern slavery statement.

            We will then ask you some additional questions about your statement. These are optional – but we strongly encourage you to complete them. All our questions relate to the period covered by your statement.

            When you submit your answers, we will publish all the information you’ve provided as a statement summary on the Modern slavery statement registry on GOV.UK. This will include a link to the full statement on your website. It will be available for public viewing.

        <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
            If you need to, you can make changes to your published answers and resubmit them. Your updated information will then replace your original answers on the registry.
