            <p>The <strong>mean</strong> hourly rate is the average hourly wage across the entire organisation so the mean Modern Slavery is a measure of the difference between women’s mean hourly wage and men’s mean hourly wage.</p>
            <p>The <strong>median</strong> hourly rate is calculated by ranking all employees from the highest paid to the lowest paid, and taking the hourly wage of the person in the middle; so the median Modern Slavery is the difference between women’s median hourly wage (the middle paid woman) and men’s median hourly wage (the middle paid man).</p>
